	<h1>Jaffa Cake Recipe</h1>
	<p> These cakes are made from a fluffy sponge layer and a circle of orange jello on the top, all covered in a layer of melted chocolate. </p>
	<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>1x135g package orange jello</li>
		<li>150ml boiling water</li>
		<li>finely grated zest of 1 small orange</li>
		<li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
		<li>50g caster sugar</li>
		<li>50g self-rising flour, sifted</li>
		<li>180g dark chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
		<li>You will also need a shallow 30x20cm baking tin, a 12 hole shallow bun tin greased with butter, and a 5cm plain round cutter</li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
		<li>Make the jello by following the directions on the package. Stir in the orange zest, the pour it into the baking tin. Let it chill in the fridge until set.</li>
		<li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees farenheit. To make the spinge, whisk the eggs and sugar together for 4-5 minutes until pale and fluffy, then fold in the flour gently but thoroughly.</li>
		<li>Spoon the sponge mixture into the bun tin to fill each hole three-quarters full (you will have some mixture left over). Bake in the heated oven for 7-9 minutes until the sponges are light golden and puffy, and they feel springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes before carefully transferring the sponges to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
		<li>When ready to assemble, gently melt the chocolate. Stir until smooth, then leave to cool and thicken slightly.</li>
		<li>Turn the orange jello out of the tin and on to a sheet of baking paper. Cut out 12 discs from the jelly using the 5cm round cutter. Sit a jello disc on top of each sponge.</li>
		<li>Spoon the melted chocolate over the jello discs - don't worry if a little chocolate dribbles down the sides. Allow to set slightly, then use a fork to create a criss-cross pattern on the top of the chocolate. Leave to set completely before serving.</li>
